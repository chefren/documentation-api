summary: Update a check
description: |
  This endpoint is used to either update one custom check OR suppress/unsuppressed one normal check.

  Some guidelines about using this endpoint:
  * When updating a custom check, you must leave `region`, `resource`, `service` attributes and `relationship.account` and `relationship.rule` unchanged.
  These are unique identifier parameters for custom checks and must be always present and unchanged once check is created.

  * Suppression of a check via this endpoint only works with FAILING checks and not successful checks.

  * The Cloud Conformity ID of a check for an Azure account contains the forward slash character `/` which needs to be replaced with the encoded character `%2F` when passed in the request URL.
  e.g to update a check for an Azure account with the ID:
  `ccc:r2gyR4cqg:SecurityCenter-008:SecurityCenter:global:/subscriptions/9f7bcadb-3626-46dx-9917-1397384797f40/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/SecurityCenterBuiltIn`
  the URL in the request body should be:
  `https://us-west-2-api.cloudconformity.com/v1/checks/ccc:r2gyR4cqg:SecurityCenter-008:SecurityCenter:global:%2Fsubscriptions%2F9f7bcadb-3626-46dx-9917-1397384797f40%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyAssignments%2FSecurityCenterBuiltIn`
