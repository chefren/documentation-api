summary: Create a check
description: |
  This endpoint is used to create a custom check. You may pass one check or an array of checks in the JSON body.
  Some guidelines about using this endpoint:
  * Each check object you enter will require `check.relationships.account`.
  If you provide an account which you don't have WRITE access to, the check will not be saved.
  * Check Ids are constructed as: `ccc:accountId:ruleId:service:region:resourceId`
  * If you add a check with the same accountId, ruleId, service, region, AND resourceId as another existing check in the database, this new check WILL write over the existing check.
  * Since resource is an optional attribute, checks entered without resource will not have the resourceId part of the check Id.
